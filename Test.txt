10. differnitate between instance and local variables.
    Insatnce:
    instance variable can declare the inside the class out side of the body of the method is clled instance variable.
   The variable can't be decalre static key word.
   One for an object.
   Instance can call directly to the static variable.

    Local variable:
             A variable can declare the inside the class, method ,constructor,block.

 13.What is the differnce between JDK,JRE, and JVM?
    Ans:    JDK:
                       jdk means java development kit. jdk contains jvm and development tools and jvm contains jre,library tools.
                       jdk is the software development tools this jdk is used to develop the java program.
                       jdk is the platformdependent.

             JRE:
                      jre means java runtime environment.The java runtime enviornnment to run the java program.
                      java runtime is platformdependent.

             JVM:
                          jvm means java virtual machine.
                          java virtual machine is process of to convert a byte code to machine code.
                          After the machine code will be exuted by the machine.
                          The jvm main process is to excute read the line by line.

     29.Explain the different types of inheritance?give example each.
     Ans:
     Inheritance it  is a machanism of one object aquries all properties and beheviour of a parent object these are five types of inheritances
     Single inheritance,multilevel inheritance,hierachiacal inheritance,multiple inheritance,hybrid inheritance
     Single inheritance:Single inheritance is a process of  to create one sub class one super class Ex;one parent class ,one child class.
            ex;animal,dog
     Multilevel inheritance:Multilevel inheritance is the process of to create one subclass can already derived form the super class.
           ex;animal,dog,baby dogs
     Hierarichal inheritance: hierarical inheritance the process of create a more than one sub class,one superclass.
           ex:animal,dog cat
     Multiple inheritance: multiple inheritance is the process of more than one super class and one  sub class .
        ex:class a,b extends class{
     Hybrid inheritance:hybrid inheritances is the combination of all inheritances.
      ex:diamond

  27.Explain the different types of constructor?
Ans:
  Constructor is a special type of method which is used to initializing  the  variables.
  Every time object created when use new () key word atleast one constructor.
  constructor same name  as class name  and method name.
   Rules of constructor:
   *constructor same name as class name method name.
   *No returntype.
  These are two types of constutor
   1.default constructor
   2.paramerized constructor

   1.Default constructor: default constructor is without parameters are called default construtor.
   2.Parameterized constructor: parameterized constructor is special type of number of parameters can declare the parameters is called parameterized constructor.

20.What is method overloading?
 Ans: method overloading its a compile time static .method  having same name different parameters.

21.What is method overriding?
Ans:method overriding is run time and runtime .method having sme nmae same parameters.

27.What is  constructor ?we can overload the constructor?
Ans :   constructor is specific type of method which is used to initializing the variables.
            Every time object created when use new keyword().
            No return type.
            Constructor Overload:
                   It is techinic of more than one constructor  with different parameters in  one constructor to perform  different tasks.

14.Can "this " key word "super" keywords be used together? 
 Ans: This :The constructor can be done with the same class. 
          Super:this construtor can be done with the call the constructor from the other construtor.

16.What is polymorphism?Explain how to achieve polymorphism in java with on Example program.
 Ans: polymorphism single actions different ways.poly means many morphism means forms.
          It is derived form greek word.
   ex.class animal
     {

 1.Why java not a pure object oriented language?
  Ans:
            its creating of a program and creating  of the object.

 2. pointers are used in c/c++ .why does java not mke  use of pointers?
 Ans:   java is not because of not using pointers  beceause of the memory area can be direct acessed which is securty issue.

 9. What  are  the memory allocation available in java?
 Ans:    variable is name of memory location which is use to hold the value at the program exution. 

4.How is an infinite loop decalred in java?
Ans:for (; ;){
                   }

6.Why main method  static in java?
 Ans:  main method static compiler can call without creation of an object.

5. can the main method  be overloaded?
 Ans :  cant be overlodaed in main method.
