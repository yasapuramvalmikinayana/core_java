1. What is var-args? Explain with Syntax
Ans: In java methods ,parameters accept argument with three dots .These are known as variable arguments.
                Syntax: sample(int args -){
                                            } 
If they are used can pass a different numbers of arguments each time you call


2. What is blocks? Explain the types of Blocks
   Ans: Blocks are set of statements used for initialization.
                *Two types of blocks 
                             1.Static block(SIB)
                            2.Non-static blocks(IIB) 
         1.Static block:
                     *Static blocks are a set of statements used to initializingstatic variables.
                                 Syntax: Static {
                                                    }
                     *We can have multiple static blocks andthe excute will happens in a sequential.
                    *In static blocks we can use only static variables.
                    * Static blocks excuted before main() or class.
        2.Non-Static blocks:
                   *Non static blocks are set of statements used to initializing static variables(not good method in non static method and Non static variables.
                   *The Non static blocks are excuted during object creation.

3. What is hashCode() ?Give example
    Ans: hashCode() Method. The hashCode() is a method of Java Integer Class which determines the hash code for a given Integer. 
             It overrides hashCode in class Object. By default, this method returns a random integer that is unique for each instance.
          hash() code methods is used to identify an object uniquely.
   ex:- class employee{
         public int hashcode(){
          return 1234;}
         public static void main(String args[]){
           Employee e = new Employee();
           sop(e.hashcode())
          } }
4. Why String is immutable? What is string constant pool
         String is immutable : when we re-initialize a string object,rather than modifying the same object,a new object 
	                              is created and the referenece pointing to the old object gets deferenced and starts pointing to the newly creted object.
         String Constant pool : String objects are stored inside a memory location .
	                            *Literal objects are stored inside constant pool and it doesnot allow duplicates.
5. Difference between character constant and String constant ?
   Ans:
       * Character constant:-
                - Character Constants are written by enclosing a character within a pair of single quotes.
                -Character Constants are assigned to variables of type char. 

        * String constant:-
                -String Constants are written by enclosing a set of characters within a pair of double quotes.
                - String Constants are assigned to variables of type String.

6. What is an Exception? explain the different types of Exception
     Ans:  Exception is an object which occur at the time of execution of program and that disturbs the flow of execution.
	Types of exception :1.Checked Exception
		              2.Unchecked Exception
	1.Checked Exception : The class that directly inherit the throwable class except runtime Exception and error.
                                                            eg:IO Exception,SQL Exception   
			These are also called as compile time.
	2.Unchecked Exception : The classes that inherit the runtime Exception.
			       eg:Arithmatic Exception
   
7. Advantages of Exception ?
    Ans:  * Separating Error-Handling Code from "Regular" Code
             * Propagating Errors Up the Call Stack
             * Grouping and Differentiating Error Types

8. Can we have try block with catch block?
     Ans :    yes ,try block with catch block, we can declare a try-catch block within another try-catch block this is called nested try-catch block.

9. Explain Throw keyword in java?
    Ans:  The throw keyword is used to throw an statement,it throws only one object at a time we cant throw multiple object.

10. Can you write any code after the throw statement?
    Ans: No,we cant write any statements after throw statement because after throw statement no statements can be executed
             or valid.

11. Explain the Finally block with example?
  Ans:   java finally block is always executed whether an exception is handled or not. 
            Therefore, it contains all the necessary statements that need to be printed regardless of the exception occurs or not.
           use of finally:
               *finally block in Java can be used to put "cleanup" code such as closing a file, closing connection, etc.
               *The important statements to be printed can be placed in the finally block.
                 The finally block follows the try-catch block.
    example: 
      class TestFinallyBlock {    
               public static void main(String args[]){    
               try{    
                  
                int data=50/5;    
                 System.out.println(data);    
                  }      
                    catch(NullPointerException e){  
                      System.out.println(e);  
                     }    
  
                   finally {  
                      System.out.println("finally block is always executed");  
                            }    
    
                      System.out.println("rest of phe code...");    
                           }    
                              }

12. What is an error?
     Ans:  Error is a interuption which might occur during the execution of program during run-time or complie-time.

13. What is “IS-A” and “HAS-A” relationship in java?
      Ans:   It is a mechanisim in which one class acquire the property of another class is called IS-A relationship.
                        HAS-A relationship is also known as association,Association is a relationship between two seperate classes 
	       establishes through their object.
	     composition and aggregation are the two forms of association.

14. Why main() method is public , static and void in java?
 Ans: because,it is the main method acess anywhere,void will return the values.

15. Can we overload the main method?
 Ans:yes

16. Can we have nested methods in java?
      Ans:   Java does not support “directly” nested methods.,Many functional programming languages support method within method.,But you can achieve nested method functionality in Java 7 or older version by define local classes, class within method so this does compile."

17. Can we write any methods in main() method?
     Ans:yes

18. What is class and object? Give example
     Ans:Class is a group of objects which have common properties.
            Class has a logical entity.eg:Block,Fields.
            Object is a real world entity which is a collection of states and behaviour.eg :Banking System.

19. What is JIT?
   Ans: In the Java programming language and environment, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler is a program that turns Java bytecode (a program that contains 
            instructions that must be interpreted) into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.

20. Explain 10 built in exceptions in java 
                               Ans:      * IOException,
		        *SQLException,
		       *ArithmeticException,
		      *NullPointerException,
		     * ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
		     * OutOfMemoryError,
		       *VirtualMachineError,
		       * AssertionError.
21. Can we create our own exception? Give example
Ans:In Java, we can create our own exceptions that are derived classes of the Exception class. Creating our own Exception is known as
        custom exception or user-defined exception. Basically, Java custom exceptions are used to customize the exception according to user need. 
       Consider the example 1 in which InvalidAgeException class extends the Exception class. Using the custom exception, we can have your own exception 
       and message.

    Code sample
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception{
  InvalidAgeException(String s){
    super(s);
  }
}
22. Explain the Try, Catch, Throw, Throws.
Ans:Try-catch block is used to handle the exception. In a try block, we write the code which may throw an exception and in catch b
        lock we write code to handle that exception. Throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.

23. String is a Keyword or not?
Ans:No

24. How to create a string object?
   Ans: Creating an object of the String class using the new keyword by passing the string value as a parameter of its constructor.
           Passing a character array to the String constructor.

25. Write a program,
1. method with parameter and return type
2. method without parameter and with return type
3. method with parameter and without return type
4. method without parameter and return type
 1 .public class EvenOrOdd {
	 
	void checks(int n)
	{
		if(n%2 == 0)
	      {
		    System.out.println(n+"is a even");
	      }
		else
		{
			System.out.println(n+"is a odd");
		}
	}
    }

  2.  class TestReturn 
 {
    int  display()
      {
    	  return 10;
      }
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	TestReturn tr = new TestReturn();
	
	tr.display();
	System.out.println(tr.display());
	
	
	
}
	
	
}

  3.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Again {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		EvenOrOdd eo = new EvenOrOdd();
		
		for(int i=1; i<=4; i++)
		{
			System.out.println("Enter the number");
			int num=sc.nextInt();
			eo.checks(num);
			System.out.println("-------------");
		}
	}

}

  4. class MethodDemo {
	
	void display()
	{
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}
public static void main(String[] args)
    {
	  System.out.println("Start");
	
	   MethodDemo md = new MethodDemo();
	   md.display();
	   
	   System.out.println("End");
	   
	}

}
